### Information

Hi! My name is Alex Prevatte. I'm a Statistics MS student in my final semester at NC State University. I work as an environmental economist for a small consulting firm, and see myself in the future using statistics and machine learning in relation to environmental modeling. I live in Durham, NC, and when I'm not working I enjoy spending time outside with my family.
